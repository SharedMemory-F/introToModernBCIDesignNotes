## Description

The introduction to Modern Brain Computer Interface Design is a fantastic way for someone new to BCI to get up and running. The course showcases BCILAB as a framework for building a fast prototyping a BCI.

I copied word for word, every slide in the every lecture into a document for each lecture, further on tough concepts, I add some personal notes which read a laymen interpretation of Kothe’s notes. 

## Directory Structure
There are four folders at this time
1. Demos
  - Outlines for each demo
    - I want to turn this into an FAQ/Quick reference for BCILAB so everything is written in first person question form for quick searching later…
2. Exercises
  - Each exercise has it’s own folder. 
  - Splits further into:
    1. Code
      - MATLAB code for this exercise
    2. Outline
      - Exercise Outlines, Notes and Instructions for this exercise
3. General
  - Contains information such as Course Information (for citing) or a Table Of Contents that I used when watching the lectures offline
4. Lectures
  - The gold of this whole Github… this are the in-depth course outlines

## Key for Lectures [How to Read these Notes]

**Bold** text indicates two different things depending on context
- In an equation, it’s a Matrix
- In a paragraph it is a critical piece of information, most likely bolded by Kothe. 

*Italic* font is used the first time you see a new definition or want to add emphasis to a word such as *very* fast

‘Code’ can be found whenever ‘this monospace style’ is used. All code in this lecture is in MATLAB
